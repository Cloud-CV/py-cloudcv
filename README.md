CloudCV - Python API's
=======================

These are the python APIs for CloudCV: Large Scale Distributed Computer Vision as a Cloud Service.
Using this package will require a config file that is located at `pcloudcv/config.example.json`. Rename it to `config.json` after editing with appropriate configuration.

**Please note that the API's are going through major overhaul. You can follow the progress by cloning the development branch.**  <br>
Instructions for cloning [here](http://batra-mlp-lab.github.io/pcloudcv/installation.html).

Refer [Documentation](http://batra-mlp-lab.github.io/pcloudcv/index.html) for a quick-start tutorial and details regarding functionalities.
