Welcome to PCloudCV's documentation!
====================================
**PCloudCV** are the python APIs for CloudCV: Large Scale Distributed Computer Vision as a Cloud Service. Using this package will require a ``config file`` that is located at ``pcloudcv/config.example.json``. Rename it to ``config.json`` after editing with appropriate configuration.

**Please note that the API's are going through major overhaul. You can follow the progress by cloning the development branch.**
